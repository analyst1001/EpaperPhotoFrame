# E-Paper Photo Frame

## Goals
- The main goal is to display photos on a E-paper display so that it looks similar to a photo frame. The displayed photo will change periodically.
- An additional goal is to allow the device to run on a common battery power source so that it can work without plugging into wall power.

This branch keeps track of designing a PCB to hold all the components for E-paper photo frame with connections to external battery, external E-paper display, external LEDs, and external SD card storage.
